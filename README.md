Tweetly is a social media application built with Next.js, designed to offer a seamless and engaging user experience. Over a two-month development period, I focused on incorporating the latest web technologies to create a responsive platform that adapts to all screen sizes. Tweetly introduces innovative features while maintaining a familiar interface, showcasing my expertise in building scalable and dynamic web applications.
